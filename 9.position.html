<!--
The position property specifies how an element is positioned in a document.

Position: static(default), relative, absolute, fixed, sticky;

Elements are basically positioned using the top, bottom, left and right properties. But, these properties will work if the position property is set.

Relative: The applied element positions changes from its original position. it will calculate from original position
still it is occupied by its original place in relative position....

Absolute: The applied element position changes from parent and change the remaining elements to its original position.
in the case of absolute the calculation will not start from original position...calculation will be starts from  nearest position parent....parent having position property then it is known as position parent..
position parent...A parent having position property like relative, fixed, absolute, sticky...not static because
by default it was having static...if there is no position parent
it will calculate from body...
