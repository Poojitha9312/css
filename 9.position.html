<!--
The position property specifies how an element is positioned in a document.

Position: static(default), relative, absolute, fixed, sticky;

Elements are basically positioned using the top, bottom, left and right properties. But, these properties will work if the position property is set.

Relative: The applied element positions changes from its original position.
Absolute: The applied element position changes from parent and change the remaining elements to its original position.
