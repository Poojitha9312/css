<!-- Step-by-step explanation of the CSS counter example

A counter named “section” is created

When the page loads, a counter called section is initialized.

Its starting value is zero.

This counter is available throughout the entire page.

Only the h2 headings are counted

The main heading (h1) is ignored.

Every h2 heading is treated as a new section that needs numbering.

A virtual element is added before each h2

Before the actual text of every h2 heading, CSS inserts extra content.

This content exists only visually and does not change the HTML.

The counter increases for each h2

Every time the browser reaches an h2 heading, the counter value increases by one.

The first h2 gets number 1, the second gets 2, and so on.

The current counter value is displayed

The increased counter number is shown before the h2 text.

It appears in the format: “Section number:”.

The numbering happens automatically

If a new h2 is added, removed, or reordered, the numbers update automatically.

No manual changes are needed.

The numbering is only for visual presentation

The numbers are generated by CSS, not part of the actual content.

Screen readers may not read these numbers.

Final result on the page

Each h2 heading appears with a section number in front of it.

The numbering is clean, automatic, and controlled entirely by CSS. -->
